# HyPNS SuperPeer
============

When you're offline or behind a NAT, it's useful to have a super peer pinning your peer-to-peer data out there.

This repo is a peer beyond the gate to keep your Hypns propagated and online.

If you want a personal super peer for your HyPNS, go to [https://glitch.com/edit/#!/glitch-super-peer](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/glitch-super-peer) and hit "Remix" to get your own copy up and running.

Should be good for a few hundred peers? Not stress tested yet.

Uses Git Glitched to deploy to Glitch with a single `git push` (see below) to keep the main repo up to date easily.

## Glitch Branch
